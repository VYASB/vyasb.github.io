I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/) working on the [RADICal](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Rachel.McDonnell/Radical.html) under the guidance of [Rachel McDonnell](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/rachel.mcdonnell/). I'm passionate about the indisciplinary research of applied machine learning and perception. So far, my work has revolved around **Virtual Humans** - their motion and emotions.

I finished my **PhD** in 2024 under the supervision of Professor [Carol O'Sullivan](https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=osullica), where I explored how body shape influences motion in virtual humans. As a **Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Early Stage Researcher** in the [CLIPE-ITN project](https://www.clipe-itn.eu/), I had the opportunity to dive deep into how virtual humans interact with the world. Along the way, I‚Äôve had the privilege of collaborating with researchers at institutions like `Amazon`, `Inria`, and the `Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems`.

My background is multidisciplinary, with a **Master‚Äôs in Computer Science** and a **Bachelor‚Äôs in Mechanical & Automation Engineering**. This has given me a diverse set of skills and perspectives that enrich my work.  

Beyond research, I‚Äôm a huge movie buff üé¨, whether it‚Äôs on screen or in the virtual worlds. I am always interested in exploring new research projects and ideas. Feell free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on any topics.
If you are still reading - so **thank you** for sticking around! üòÅ I‚Äôm excited about the road ahead and the endless possibilities in this field. Adios!
