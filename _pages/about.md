Hi there, welcome to my personal page! I am a PhD candidate at the Trinity College Dublin, in [Graphics & Vision Group](https://gv2.scss.tcd.ie/) of School of Computer Sceince and Statistics under the supervision of [Carol O'Sullivan](https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=osullica) and [Sara Magliacane]. Earlier I have worked together with [Jakub M. Tomczak](https://jmtomczak.github.io/) for my Master Thesis on [Approximate Bayesian Computation for discrete data](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/3/312) at Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, which was nominated for best Master Thesis award. 

My PhD research is focused on learning `dynamical systems`. In particular, we want to learn dynamics from high-dimensional data with physical constraints that enforces the model to learn the _true_ dynamics, rather than overfitting the data. My work mainly focuses on two domains: (i) `object-centric dynamics` (learning trajectories from object/animal recordings), or (ii) `fluid dynamics` (climate model recordings). As part of the exploration process I am investigating the connections between dynamics and geometry. 

Broadly my research interests are 

- dynamical systems (ODEs/SDEs/PDEs)
- gaussian processes
- generarive models 
- geometry for dynamics
