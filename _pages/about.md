Hey there! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/) on the [RADICal](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Rachel.McDonnell/Radical.html) under the guidance of the amazing [Rachel McDonnell](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/rachel.mcdonnell/). I'm passionate about the exciting fusion of Virtual Reality (VR) 🕶️, Machine Learning 🤖, and Applied Perception. My work revolves around **virtual humans**, particularly their motion and body shape.

I completed my PhD under the guidance of Professor [Carol O'Sullivan](https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=osullica), where I explored how body shape influences motion in virtual humans, pushing the limits of immersive experiences. As a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Early Stage Researcher in the [CLIPE-ITN project](https://www.clipe-itn.eu/), I got to dive even deeper into how virtual humans interact with the world. Along the way, I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with top researchers at institutions like `Amazon`, `Inria`, and the `Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems` — an experience that has truly shaped my academic journey.  

My background is as **multidisciplinary as it gets**! With a **Master’s in Computer Science (specializing in VR & AR) 🖥️** and a **Bachelor’s in Mechanical & Automation Engineering ⚙️**, I bring a diverse set of skills and perspectives to my work.  

Beyond research, I’m a **huge movie buff 🎬**—always up for a great story, whether it’s on screen or in the virtual worlds I help create. Whether I’m **pushing the boundaries of human-computer interaction** or **experimenting with new VR ideas**, curiosity keeps me going! 🚀  

If you’ve made it this far — **thank you** for sticking around! 😁 I’m excited about the road ahead and the endless possibilities in this field. Let’s create something amazing!
