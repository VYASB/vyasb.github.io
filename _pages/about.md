Hey there, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/) under the supervision of [Rachel McDonnell](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/rachel.mcdonnell/) under the [RADICal](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Rachel.McDonnell/Radical.html) project. My research area is an interesting combination of Virtual Reality, Machine Learning and Motion Perception. The research work also focus on virtual humans, primarily their motion and body shape. 

I finished my PhD under the guidance of Professor [Carol O'Sullivan](https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=osullica), where I explored the relationship between body shape and motion of virtual humans, aiming to push the boundaries of what's possible in immersive experiences. As a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Early Stage Researcher, I am privileged to be part of the [CLIPE-ITN project](https://www.clipe-itn.eu/), exploring into the fascinating topic of virtual humans and their interactions with the world. My academic journey has been enriched by collaborations with esteemed institutions such as `Amazon`, `Inria`, and the `Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems`, where I've had the opportunity to contribute and collaborate with leading researchers in the field.

My academic background reflects my multidisciplinary approach to research. With a Master's degree in Computer Science, specializing in Virtual & Augmented Reality, and a Bachelor's degree in `Mechanical & Automation Engineering`, I bring a diverse set of skills and perspectives to my work.

Beyond research and academia, I am deeply passionate about movies. Whether it's exploring new ideas in virtual reality or pushing the boundaries of human-computer interaction, I am driven by a relentless curiosity and a desire to make a difference in the world of technology.

Thank you for taking the time to read this far and not giving up üòÅ. I am excited about the journey ahead and the possibilities that lie on the horizon.
