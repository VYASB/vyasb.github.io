I am a PhD candidate at [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/), with a primary focus on virtual humans, their motion, and motion perception. As a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Early Stage Researcher, I am privileged to be part of the [ITN-CLIPE project](https://www.clipe-itn.eu/), exploring into the fascinating topic of virtual humans and their interactions with the world.

Under the guidance of Professor [Carol O'Sullivan](https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=osullica), I am exploring the intricate nuances of virtual human motion, aiming to push the boundaries of what's possible in immersive experiences. My academic journey has been enriched by collaborations with esteemed institutions such as Amazon, Inria, and the Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, where I've had the opportunity to contribute and collaborate with leading researchers in the field.

My academic background reflects my multidisciplinary approach to research. With a Master's degree in Computer Science, specializing in Virtual & Augmented Reality, and a Bachelor's degree in `Mechanical & Automation Engineering`, I bring a diverse set of skills and perspectives to my work.

Beyond research and academia, I am deeply passionate about movies. Whether it's exploring new avenues in virtual reality or pushing the boundaries of human-computer interaction, I am driven by a relentless curiosity and a desire to make a difference in the world of technology.

Thank you for taking the time to read this far and not giving up. I am excited about the journey ahead and the possibilities that lie on the horizon.
