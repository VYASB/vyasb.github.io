### Understanding Diffusion Models: A Unified Perspective

This is just me reading this paper and making some notes on the go. Let me know if someone wants to discuss the paper or find something intersting in my notes. Pardon my casual poor language skills throughout ðŸ˜„

> I will try to go through some concepts in detail, while we also talk briefly through other relevant concepts. The text is purely my interpretation of the published work by Calvin Luo, and please dont use these notes to understand the paper. Rather think of this text as an exercise to check if you understood the concepts better than me or not ðŸ˜‰
