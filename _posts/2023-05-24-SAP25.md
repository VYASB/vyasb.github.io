#### Abstract

This study explores how facial expression intensity and ambient lighting color influence gaze behavior and perceived emotional intensity in virtual avatars. Using high-resolution eye tracking, participants viewed avatars displaying three emotions (anger, disgust, and joy) at four intensity levels under red, blue, and white lighting. Results show that participants could reliably distinguish between intensity levels, with the eye region attracting the most attention across conditions. Lighting color significantly influenced pupil diameter, suggesting effects on physiological arousal, but had minimal impact on where users looked. These findings offer insights into designing emotionally expressive virtual characters for games, VR, and digital media.

#### Key Findings

1. Participants rated high-intensity expressions as more emotionally intense.

2. The eye region consistently received the most visual attention across all emotions and lighting conditions.

3. Lighting color (especially blue) significantly increased pupil size, indicating arousal—but did not alter gaze allocation.

4. Gaze behavior varied subtly by emotion and expression intensity, especially in the mouth and nose regions.

5. Static images of avatars were used to precisely control visual cues; future work will explore dynamic expressions and immersive environments.

#### Why this work is important?

As virtual humans become more common in games, storytelling, and VR, understanding how users perceive their emotions is essential. This work shows how subtle design choices—like expression intensity and lighting—can shape user perception and engagement.
