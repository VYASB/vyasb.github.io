title:  Emotional Intensity Through the Eyes: Gaze Behavior Toward Expressive Virtual Avatars
date:   2023-03-24
description: Virtual humans are increasingly used in games, films, and interactive media. Yet, understanding the role of emotional intensity remains critical for expressive character design. This work investigates the gaze behavior in expressive virtual avatars with varying levels of facial expression intensity and light colors. Using eye tracking, we analyzed visual attention patterns as participants viewed avatars displaying three emotions (anger, disgust, and joy) at four intensity levels (neutral, low, medium, and high) under three light colors (white, red, and blue). Participants rated the perceived intensity of each expression while their gaze data was recorded. Results indicate that participants consistently distinguished between intensity levels, with higher ratings corresponding to more intense expressions. The eye region received the highest number of fixations and visits, though gaze distribution across facial features varied by emotion. Additionally, lighting color significantly affected pupil diameter.
